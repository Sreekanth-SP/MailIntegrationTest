# MailIntegrationTest
> `Using Springboot Annotations and API calls using Java.
Make objects and return them using getMappings annotations.
These objects should not be initialized manually, they are created by Spring Framework via DI and IOC. Some of the annotations used by this project are @Autowired, @Configuration, @Bean etc.`

### 1. Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control

   **What is Dependency Injection?**

   Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern in which the dependencies of a class are provided externally, rather than the class itself creating them. It helps to decouple components and promotes easier testing and maintainability. Spring Framework provides a powerful DI mechanism through IOC containers.

   **What is Inversion of Control?**

   Inversion of Control (IOC) is a broader concept that refers to the inversion of control flow in a system. It means that rather than the components controlling the flow, the framework/container takes control and manages the dependencies and lifecycle of the components.

   **Benefits of DI and IOC in Spring**

   * Loose coupling between components, enabling easier maintenance and testing.
   * Increased modularity and scalability of the application.
   * Improved code reusability and separation of concerns.
   * Promotes cleaner and more maintainable code.
  
### 2. Spring Framework Overview

The Spring Framework is a popular Java-based framework that provides comprehensive support for building enterprise-level applications. It offers various modules for different functionalities, including DI and IOC.

Key features of the Spring Framework:

* Lightweight and non-intrusive.
* Supports various application architectures, such as MVC, REST, and microservices.
* Provides extensive support for database integration, transaction management, and security.
* Simplifies unit testing and integration testing.
* Offers seamless integration with other frameworks and technologies.

### 3. Setting up a Spring Project

To get started with a Spring project, follow these steps:

1. Set up a Java development environment (e.g., install JDK and set up an IDE).
1. Create a new Maven or Gradle project.
1. Add the required Spring dependencies to your project's build file.
1. Configure the project's structure according to the chosen architecture (e.g., MVC).
1. Define Spring bean configurations and specify component scanning if needed.
1. Implement your application logic using Spring components.
  
### 4. Configuring Dependency Injection in Spring

Spring Framework offers multiple ways to configure Dependency Injection. Here are some commonly used approaches:

* XML-based Configuration: Configure beans and their dependencies using XML configuration files.
* Annotation-based Configuration: Use annotations like `@Component`, `@Autowired`, and `@Qualifier` to define beans and their dependencies.
* Java-based Configuration: Use Java classes annotated with `@Configuration`, `@Bean`, and other annotations to define beans and their dependencies.
  
### 5. Integrating Mail Functionality in Spring
Spring provides excellent support for integrating mail functionality into your application. Here's a high-level overview of the steps involved:

1. Configure the Mail Server: Specify the mail server details (host, port, credentials, etc.) in your application configuration file.
1. Set up the Mail Sender: Create an instance of the `MIMailHandler` interface, which represents the mail sender. Configure it with the required properties.
1. Compose and Send Emails: Use the `MIMailHandler` instance to create

## Conclusion

This README file provides a brief overview and guide for using the Spring Framework to implement Dependency Injection (DI) and Inversion of Control (IOC) concepts, as well as integrating mail functionality into your Spring application. Overall, the Spring Framework, along with DI, IOC, and mail integration capabilities, empowers developers to build robust and scalable applications with ease.
